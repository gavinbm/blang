After studying the manual and how B is supposed to work I've decided to not bother writing the compiler since translating between what B thinks is sensible and what modern computer science thinks is sensible is too much work and I'd rather play street fighter

I'll leave the manual here for safekeeping since I found it on the wayback machine and I'm not sure if it'll be there forever
